# Jobs System

## Overview

NAM-BOT jobs are the runnable training units of the app. A job combines:

- a preset reference for the base NAM training recipe
- the paired input and output audio file paths used for the capture
- a small set of run-specific overrides such as epochs and latency
- optional NAM metadata that can be written back into the finished model

Jobs are intentionally separate from presets.

- presets define reusable training recipes
- jobs define one specific training run
- queue items freeze a job at enqueue time so later edits do not mutate an already queued run

## Goals

- Keep everyday job creation simple for users who just want to point at files and run training.
- Support batch-oriented workflows through drafts, queueing, drag-and-drop creation, and retry.
- Preserve enough run context to inspect output folders, logs, progress, and final artifacts.
- Keep editable drafts separate from frozen queue items so the queue stays predictable.

## User Experience

### Jobs Page

The Jobs screen is split into a few major states:

- an editor for creating or editing one job
- a drafts list for saved-but-not-yet-queued jobs
- a queue section for waiting jobs
- a training/history section for active and finished runs

When the page is empty, it invites the user to either:

- click `New Job`
- drag output audio files onto the page to create drafts quickly

### Draft Jobs

Draft jobs are editable saved jobs that have not been frozen into the queue yet.

- `New Job` opens an in-memory editor session first.
- Saving a new job creates a backend draft through `jobs:createDraft`.
- Saving an existing draft updates it through `jobs:saveDraft`.
- Draft cards expose `Edit`, `Queue`, `Copy`, and `Delete`.
- `Queue All` enqueues every valid draft and skips drafts missing required fields.

Drafts are where users can iterate safely before they commit a run to the queue.

### Drag And Drop Draft Creation

The Jobs page supports dragging output audio files directly onto the main panel.

- supported file extensions include `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.flac`
- each dropped output file becomes its own draft
- the draft name defaults to the output filename without extension
- the output root defaults to the dropped file's directory
- the input audio defaults to the bundled NAM training signal when available
- the preset defaults to the last-used visible preset, then the default preset, then the first visible preset

This is intended to speed up common “I already have my re-amped captures on disk” workflows.

### Job Editor

The editor is used when:

- creating a new job
- editing an existing draft

The editor includes:

- job name
- input audio source
- output audio path
- output root directory mode
- preset selection
- training overrides for epochs and latency
- NAM metadata fields for the final `.nam` artifact

The editor shows `Save Job` buttons at both the top and bottom of the form.

- Save buttons stay neutral when the editor is clean.
- Save buttons turn green only when the job has unsaved changes and the current editor state is valid to save.
- Clicking `Cancel` with unsaved edits opens a confirm dialog so the user can save, keep editing, or discard changes.

### Input Audio Modes

Input audio can be driven in two ways:

- `Default`
  - uses the bundled NAM `v3_0_0.wav` training signal
  - can optionally be exported to disk with `Save Default to Disk`
- `Custom`
  - lets the user browse to a specific input audio file

### Output Root Modes

The output root directory can be driven in three ways:

- `Output Audio Path`
  - follows the directory of the chosen output audio file
- `Settings Default Path`
  - uses the default output root from Settings when configured
- `Custom`
  - lets the user browse to a specific directory

### Queue View

Queued jobs appear in their own section.

- queued items can be reordered by drag-and-drop
- only queued and validating items are reorderable
- `Unqueue All` restores waiting queue items back into drafts
- individual queued jobs can also be unqueued one at a time

The queue UI shows the queued list in reverse visual order compared to the internal logical queue so the “next up” behavior feels natural in the interface.

### Training And History View

Active and finished jobs appear in the training section.

- active jobs surface stop and force-stop controls
- finished jobs can be retried
- result folders can be opened from the UI
- terminal logs can be expanded and refreshed while a job is active
- `Clear Finished` removes finished runtime entries from the queue history panel

## Job Schema

Jobs use the `JobSpec` schema.

```ts
interface JobSpec {
  id: string
  name: string
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
  presetId: string | null
  tags: string[]
  inputAudioPath: string
  inputAudioIsDefault: boolean
  outputAudioPath: string
  outputRootDir: string
  outputRootDirIsDefault: boolean
  metadata: {
    name?: string
    modeledBy?: string
    gearType?: 'amp' | 'pedal' | 'pedal_amp' | 'amp_cab' | 'amp_pedal_cab' | 'preamp' | 'studio' | ''
    gearMake?: string
    gearModel?: string
    toneType?: 'clean' | 'overdrive' | 'crunch' | 'hi_gain' | 'fuzz' | ''
    inputLevelDbu?: number
    outputLevelDbu?: number
  }
  trainingOverrides: {
    epochs?: number
    latencySamples?: number
  }
  uiNotes?: string
}
```

### Schema Notes

- `presetId` links the run to a training preset rather than embedding the full recipe.
- `inputAudioIsDefault` records whether the bundled default training signal is being used.
- `outputRootDirIsDefault` tracks whether the root is following an automatic mode versus a custom folder choice.
- `trainingOverrides` are intentionally narrow. Jobs override only the fields that need run-specific flexibility.
- `metadata` is for NAM artifact tagging, not for configuring the core training recipe.

## Runtime State

Queued and finished runs use a separate runtime object, `JobRuntimeState`.

Important runtime fields include:

- `jobId`, `jobName`, and `status`
- `frozenJob` for the exact job snapshot that was queued
- timestamps such as `queuedAt`, `startedAt`, and `finishedAt`
- progress fields such as `plannedEpochs` and `currentEpoch`
- resolved paths such as workspace, run directory, generated configs, logs, and published model output
- terminal progress summaries, checkpoint summaries, device summaries, and user-facing messages

### Job Status Values

Jobs move through these statuses:

- `draft`
- `queued`
- `validating`
- `preparing`
- `running`
- `stopping`
- `succeeded`
- `failed`
- `canceled`

Stop requests use two modes:

- `graceful`
- `force`

## What The Editor Fields Drive

The friendly job editor fields map to concrete training behavior.

- `Job Name`
  - labels the draft and queue item in the UI
- `Input Audio`
  - points to the dry training signal used by the run
- `Output Audio`
  - points to the re-amped capture that NAM is learning from
- `Output Root Directory`
  - controls where the run workspace and artifacts are written
- `Preset`
  - selects the base training recipe
- `Epochs`
  - overrides the preset default unless the preset locks that field
- `Latency / Delay`
  - writes to `data.common.delay` for `nam-full`
- `NAM Metadata`
  - is written back into the final `.nam` file after a successful run

If a selected preset locks epochs or latency through expert config, the job editor shows those fields as read-only.

## Queue Lifecycle

The normal job lifecycle is:

1. create or edit an in-memory job editor session
2. save it into the draft list
3. enqueue one or more drafts
4. freeze the draft into a queue item with a new task id
5. run validation, preparation, and training
6. inspect logs, output folders, and final artifacts
7. optionally retry, clear, or unqueue depending on state

### Freeze-On-Enqueue

When a draft is enqueued:

- the draft is cloned
- a new queue/task id is assigned
- the queue item stores that cloned `frozenJob`
- the original editable draft is removed from the drafts list

This prevents a user from accidentally changing the meaning of an already queued run.

### Unqueue And Retry

- `Unqueue` restores a queued item back into drafts.
- `Unqueue All` restores every waiting queue item back into drafts.
- `Retry` reuses the frozen job from a finished run and schedules it again.
- `Clear Finished` removes finished history items from the queue manager view.

## Persistence

### Draft Storage

Saved draft jobs are persisted in the Electron user data folder:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\NAM-BOT\\drafts.json`

This file stores the editable draft list, not the currently open unsaved editor session.

### Queue Storage

Queue runtime state is persisted separately:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\NAM-BOT\\queue.json`

This is handled by the queue manager and represents queued, active, and historical runtime items rather than editable drafts.

### Editor Session Persistence

The open job editor session is renderer-memory only.

- switching to another section does not discard the open editor session
- returning to Jobs restores the in-progress editor state
- the renderer session includes form values, selected preset, input mode, output-root mode, and validation visibility
- closing the app still discards an unsaved editor session that was never saved as a draft

## IPC And Process Boundaries

The Jobs feature spans the renderer and Electron main process.

### Renderer Responsibilities

- display drafts, queue items, logs, and editor state
- hold the unsaved editor session
- validate required fields for save and queue affordances
- react to queue-update and job-update events

### Main Process Responsibilities

- persist saved drafts
- open audio pickers and result folders
- manage queue operations such as enqueue, unqueue, retry, reorder, and clear
- resolve the bundled default training signal path
- launch and monitor actual training work through the queue manager

Important IPC handlers include:

- `jobs:createDraft`
- `jobs:saveDraft`
- `jobs:deleteDraft`
- `jobs:listDrafts`
- `jobs:enqueue`
- `jobs:enqueueMany`
- `jobs:unqueue`
- `jobs:unqueueAll`
- `jobs:retry`
- `jobs:reorder`
- `jobs:listQueue`
- `jobs:openResultFolder`
- `jobs:chooseAudioFile`
- `jobs:getDefaultInputAudioPath`
- `jobs:saveDefaultAudioTo`

## Relationship To Presets

Jobs depend on presets but should stay smaller and more tactical than presets.

- presets define the base architecture and training recipe
- jobs point at one preset and override only a few run-specific fields
- the last-used preset helps seed faster new-job creation
- preset locking rules can make job fields read-only when the preset explicitly owns them

This separation keeps:

- job creation fast
- preset reuse consistent
- queue behavior predictable

## Example Draft Job

```json
{
  "id": "8f32d3e2-5d2d-4f44-a7fd-d7ac1f1f4c55",
  "name": "JCM800 SM57 Edge",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-12T20:10:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-03-12T20:14:00.000Z",
  "presetId": "wavenet-standard",
  "tags": [],
  "inputAudioPath": "C:\\Users\\dave\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\NAM-BOT\\resources\\v3_0_0.wav",
  "inputAudioIsDefault": true,
  "outputAudioPath": "D:\\Captures\\JCM800\\edge-of-breakup.wav",
  "outputRootDir": "D:\\Captures\\JCM800",
  "outputRootDirIsDefault": true,
  "metadata": {
    "name": "JCM800 Edge",
    "modeledBy": "Dave",
    "gearType": "amp",
    "gearMake": "Marshall",
    "gearModel": "JCM800",
    "toneType": "crunch",
    "inputLevelDbu": 4,
    "outputLevelDbu": -10
  },
  "trainingOverrides": {
    "epochs": 100,
    "latencySamples": 0
  }
}
```

## Current Defaults

Current built-in job defaults are aligned with the default WaveNet preset path.

- job name starts as `New Job`
- preset defaults to `wavenet-standard`
- input audio defaults to the bundled NAM v3 training signal
- epochs default to the preset epoch default
- latency defaults to `0`
- output paths start empty until the user chooses files or creates drafts from dropped files

## Future Extensions

Likely future additions to the jobs system:

- richer batch creation flows
- more explicit draft tagging or grouping
- draft import/export
- stronger run templates for repeated capture workflows
- deeper queue filtering and history views
- richer validation around file pairing and sample-rate mismatches

The Jobs system should continue to favor a clear split between:

- unsaved renderer editor state
- persisted editable drafts
- frozen queue/runtime records

That separation is what keeps both the editing flow and the queue behavior understandable.

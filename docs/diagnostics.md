# Diagnostics Screen

## Overview

The Diagnostics screen is NAM-BOT's main environment-health page.

It is designed to answer two practical questions before or during training:

- can NAM-BOT actually reach the configured NAM backend
- can that backend use the accelerator path you expect, especially CUDA on Windows or MPS on Apple Silicon

The screen is intentionally split into backend validation and accelerator diagnostics so users can tell the difference between "NAM is not set up correctly" and "NAM works, but GPU support is not healthy yet."

## Goals

- Give users a fast pass/fail check for the currently selected backend target.
- Explain common Conda, Python, NAM, torch, and accelerator problems in plain language.
- Provide copyable commands for the most likely fixes without forcing users to build commands by hand.
- Export enough context for deeper troubleshooting in support threads or LLM tools when the built-in guidance is not enough.

## User Experience

### Automatic Loading

The Diagnostics screen auto-loads its checks when the page opens.

- backend validation runs if there is no current validation snapshot
- accelerator diagnostics run if there is no current accelerator snapshot
- the `Re-check` button refreshes both panels together

This keeps the page useful as a quick status check even when the user has not manually triggered anything yet.

### Backend Diagnostics Panel

The top panel focuses on basic backend reachability.

It shows an overall status banner:

- `BACKEND READY`
- `BACKEND NOT READY`

It then breaks the result into individual checks:

- Conda reachable
- environment reachable
- Python reachable
- NAM installed
- full NAM entry path available

Each check shows:

- a pass or fail state
- a plain-language message
- a suggested next action when one is available

This panel is meant to answer "Can NAM-BOT actually run the configured training environment at all?"

### Accelerator Diagnostics Panel

The second panel focuses on torch and hardware visibility.

The exact meaning depends on the machine:

- Windows + NVIDIA users will mostly care about CUDA visibility.
- Windows + AMD GPU (RX 7000, RX 9000, PRO W7000 series) users will see ROCm GPU visibility.
- Apple Silicon users will mostly care about MPS visibility.
- CPU-only systems may still be healthy if no supported accelerator is expected.

The summary banner collapses the result into one of a few user-facing states:

- `GPU READY`
- `CHECK LIGHTNING`
- `CPU-ONLY TORCH`
- `CUDA NOT VISIBLE`
- `NOT CHECKED`
- `PROBE FAILED`

This panel is meant to answer "If training runs, will it use the hardware path I expect?"

### AMD ROCm Accelerator Support

NAM-BOT detects AMD GPU acceleration through PyTorch's ROCm support on Windows. When an AMD GPU is properly configured:

- The accelerator panel displays `✓ ROCM GPU READY`
- The detail message shows "ROCm (AMD) GPU is visible"
- The HIP version is reported in the extended details

**How ROCm Detection Works**

AMD's ROCm PyTorch builds use HIP (Heterogeneous-Interface for Portability) to map GPU acceleration through PyTorch's existing CUDA API. This means:

- `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True` for ROCm builds
- `torch.cuda.device_count()` accurately reflects AMD GPUs
- NAM-BOT differentiates AMD from NVIDIA by checking `torch.version.hip`

When `torch.version.hip` has a value (and `torch.version.cuda` is `None`), NAM-BOT displays ROCm-specific messaging rather than CUDA messaging.

**Hardware and OS Support**

- **Windows**: AMD Radeon RX 7000, RX 9000, and PRO W7000 series GPUs via official ROCm wheels
- **Python Version**: Python 3.12 is strictly required for official Windows ROCm PyTorch wheels
- **macOS**: ROCm is not supported on macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon). Intel Mac users must use CPU-only training.

**Details Toggle Fields**

The expanded accelerator details include:

- ROCm HIP version (shows the ROCm SDK version when using AMD GPU)
- All existing CUDA, MPS, and host GPU fields

### Details Toggle

Accelerator details are collapsed by default behind `Show Details`.

When expanded, the panel shows the concrete probe facts that NAM-BOT collected, including:

- selected target environment
- Python version, executable, and platform
- host NVIDIA visibility and driver info
- torch import state, version, and CUDA build
- CUDA availability and device count
- MPS availability on supported macOS systems
- NAM import state and version
- Lightning package state and CUDA agreement

This is the "what did the app actually see?" layer of the screen.

## Guided Fixes

When the accelerator probe identifies a known problem shape, the Diagnostics screen shows a guidance card with ready-to-copy commands.

The current guided paths cover cases such as:

- torch missing
- torch import failing
- NAM missing
- NAM import failing
- CPU-only torch on a machine that appears to have NVIDIA hardware
- CUDA not visible from the selected environment
- torch and Lightning disagreeing about CUDA
- probe execution failures

The commands are generated against the user's currently selected backend target, so the same screen works for:

- Conda environment name mode
- Conda prefix mode
- direct Python mode

When the target uses Conda, the guidance can also include an activation step before the repair commands.

## Troubleshooting Export

If backend validation fails or accelerator status is anything other than fully ready, the screen exposes a troubleshooting export section.

That section supports two exports:

- `Copy AI Troubleshooting Prompt`
- `Copy Raw Diagnostics JSON`

### AI Troubleshooting Prompt

The AI prompt is written for tools like ChatGPT or Claude.

It includes:

- host platform details from the running app
- the active NAM-BOT backend configuration
- backend validation results
- accelerator diagnostics results
- already-prepared verification and repair commands for the exact target environment

The prompt explicitly asks the assistant for:

1. the most likely root cause
2. exact commands to run next
3. how to verify the fix succeeded
4. whether NAM training should use GPU after the fix

This is meant to save users from manually restating their machine details and failed checks from scratch.

### Raw Diagnostics JSON

The raw JSON export is a structured snapshot of the same diagnostic state.

It is useful for:

- issue reports
- support threads
- manual inspection
- pasting into other tools that prefer structured input

## Common Reading Guide

### If Backend Is Not Ready

Start with the backend panel first.

- fix Conda path or environment targeting problems before worrying about GPU state
- use the per-check suggestion text as the first next step
- once backend validation passes, run `Re-check` and then revisit accelerator status

### If Backend Is Ready But GPU Is Not

Start with the accelerator panel.

- if the machine is intended to be CPU-only, `CPU-ONLY TORCH` may be completely acceptable
- if the machine should use NVIDIA CUDA, pay attention to torch build state, CUDA availability, and host NVIDIA visibility
- if the machine is Apple Silicon, pay attention to the reported `MPS available` field rather than NVIDIA host checks
- if torch sees CUDA but Lightning does not, inspect package mismatch rather than reinstalling NAM immediately

### If The Built-In Fixes Are Not Enough

Use the troubleshooting export.

- copy the AI prompt for a plain-language next-step walkthrough
- copy the JSON if you need a fuller structured snapshot
- include the probe notes if you are filing a bug or asking someone else to help debug the machine

## Process Boundaries

The Diagnostics feature spans both the renderer and Electron main process.

### Renderer Responsibilities

- display validation and accelerator summaries
- show pass/fail cards and extended probe facts
- surface ready-to-copy commands and exports
- manage local UI state such as details toggles and export visibility

### Main Process Responsibilities

- validate the configured backend target
- launch the accelerator probe against the selected environment
- collect host and runtime details
- return structured summaries that the renderer can display directly

## Relationship To Settings

Diagnostics depends on the current Settings target.

- changing backend mode changes which environment is probed
- changing the Conda executable path changes which Conda install NAM-BOT uses
- changing the environment name, prefix, or direct Python path changes the target for all validation and repair commands

In practice, Settings answers "what should NAM-BOT use?" and Diagnostics answers "does that target actually work?"

## Future Extensions

Likely future additions to the Diagnostics screen:

- clearer differentiation between expected CPU-only systems and unexpected GPU failures
- richer host-hardware summaries
- more targeted remediation paths for package-version conflicts
- optional export-to-file support for support bundles
- tighter cross-platform guidance for macOS and future Linux support

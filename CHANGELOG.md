# Changelog

All notable changes to NAM-BOT will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Robust run-directory resolution for queued jobs, including fallback artifact-signature detection when timestamp ordering alone is ambiguous
- Focused Vitest coverage for delayed and out-of-order output-folder creation during queue handoff

### Changed

- Jobs screen collapsed runtime cards now use a status-specific summary layout so each state surfaces the most useful details at a glance (preset and epochs for queued/validating, live timing and progress for active runs, runtime plus outcome context for finished runs)
- Completed collapsed cards now show `Preset`, `Total Runtime`, and `Final ESR` without requiring expansion
- Failed and canceled collapsed cards now prioritize total runtime and stop/failure context, and show ESR only when checkpoint data exists
- Queue cards now include planned epochs in the default collapsed row for both queued and validating items
- Jobs system documentation now includes the new collapsed-card quick-stat behavior matrix
- Jobs documentation now explains the full run-folder detection timeline between one task completing and the next task starting

### Fixed

- Queue handoff no longer attaches the next task's `.log`, ESR metadata, or final `.nam` naming data to the previous run folder when NAM output directories appear late

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Focused Vitest regression coverage for preset normalization and generated `model.json` output so legacy custom architectures stay pinned to their intended network config

### Changed

- Preset docs now explicitly describe automatic compatibility handling for older NAM-BOT custom-architecture exports

### Fixed

- Queued jobs now wait for their own fresh timestamped output folder before mirroring the training `.log`, preventing ESR tracking and final `.nam` metadata work from binding to the previous run's folder
- Legacy NAM-BOT custom presets from older releases now normalize raw `expert.model` architecture snippets into the canonical `net.config` shape so existing presets generate the correct custom `.nam` architecture instead of the standard WaveNet default

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- NAM version check in Diagnostics screen showing installed vs latest GitHub release version
- Automatic detection of installed NAM version from configured Python environment
- GitHub releases integration fetching latest version from official NAM repository
- Status badges for up-to-date, update available, and unable-to-check states
- Copyable pip upgrade command when update is available
- Version caching (24 hours) to avoid GitHub API rate limiting
- Graceful handling of offline and rate-limited scenarios

### Changed

- Diagnostics screen now includes dedicated NAM Version Check panel between backend and accelerator diagnostics
- Version check auto-loads with other diagnostics on screen open

### Fixed

- GitHub API endpoint corrected to use official `sdatkinson/neural-amp-modeler` repository instead of incorrect `nam-ml/model`
- Version cache file location moved to app data directory to avoid permission errors

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- AMD ROCm GPU support for Windows with automatic detection via HIP version
- AMD Radeon RX 7000/9000 and PRO W7000 series GPU support in diagnostics and dashboard
- New "AMD ROCm (Windows)" setup path in Help screen with Python 3.12 installation steps
- ROCm-specific diagnostic guidance with verification commands and HIP version reporting
- Dashboard display showing "AMD GPU: [device name]" for ROCm builds

### Changed

- Setup guide grid updated to 4-column layout for better visual balance across all GPU paths
- Diagnostics panel now correctly shows "✓ GPU READY" for all valid GPU configurations (NVIDIA, AMD, Apple Silicon)
- Help screen updated to mention AMD ROCm support in accelerator diagnostics

### Fixed

- Accelerator diagnostics label displaying "PROBE FAILED" for working CUDA and MPS GPUs
- GPU success state routing in Diagnostics panel to properly check issue types instead of status values

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- macOS beta support with packaged `arm64` and `x64` DMG outputs, platform-aware backend defaults, and macOS CI build coverage
- Maintainer-run `Release macOS Beta` workflow so macOS DMGs can be attached to an existing tagged release after verification
- Maintainer-facing macOS support notes under `docs/`

### Changed

- Setup guidance, settings copy, and diagnostics documentation now include macOS terminology such as Terminal, Apple Silicon, MPS, and Finder where relevant
- Release workflow now keeps the normal `v*` tag path focused on Windows while allowing macOS beta assets to lag behind until they are explicitly built and reviewed

### Fixed

- Conda detection, file-picker behavior, and renderer fallback paths so backend setup no longer assumes Windows-only executable names on macOS

## [0.3.6] - 2026-03-17

### Changed

- Job editor output-root modes now prioritize the Settings default path first, then the training output file folder, then a custom folder
- New drafts and drag-and-drop draft creation now remember the last saved output-root mode so repeated capture workflows keep the same preference
- Settings now labels the saved output location as `Default Model Output Root` to make its role in new draft creation clearer
- Windows release packaging now uses the committed `electron-builder.yml` profile in GitHub Actions so published installers carry the intended NAM-BOT app identity, icons, and shortcut settings

### Fixed

- New drafts now actually use the configured Settings output root as the default model output folder instead of always following the training output file folder
- Windows release packaging now skips native dependency rebuilds in the builder profile so the release workflow does not depend on a local Visual Studio toolchain

### Notes

- Early adopters updating from the first public Windows builds may need to uninstall the older NAM-BOT entry once if Windows shows a duplicate app entry during this installer identity transition

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Job editor option to append the final validation ESR to the exported `.nam` filename after training finishes

### Changed

- Jobs documentation updated for the new filename options and ordering

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Help menu `Check for Updates` action that forces a fresh GitHub release check and shows a native result dialog
- Job editor checkbox to append the selected preset name to the exported `.nam` filename, plus a remembered default for new jobs and drag-and-drop drafts

### Changed

- Help menu now groups `Check for Updates` with `About NAM-BOT` at the bottom where version-related actions are easier to find
- Jobs screen elapsed and remaining training time now reflect the full run instead of only the current epoch
- Desktop shell, About, and Jobs docs updated for the new update-check and job-output naming behaviors

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-16
